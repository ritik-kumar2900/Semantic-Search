The three different listing compliance types are summarized below:_x005F_x000D_\\n_x005F_x000D_\\nProduct Adoption: this compliance type is used to see if any listings (or variations within multiple-variation listings) are violating eBay's new Product-Based Commerce requirement. As of May 2018, some eBay categories and product brands started requiring that sellers list those products using an eBay catalog product. If a seller does not use a catalog product for categories/brands applicable to the Product-Based Commerce requirement, a create or revise listing action will be blocked. For more information on the Product-Based Shopping Experience mandate, see the Product-Based Shopping Experience Playbook. The Product Adoption compliance type also applies to any listings (or variations within multiple-variation listings) that are missing product identifiers in item specifics, and when variations within multiple-variation listings are wrongfully sharing the same identifier values. In the API interface, the enumeration value for this compliance type is PRODUCT_ADOPTION._x005F_x000D_\\nHTTPS protocol: this compliance type is used to see if any listings are violating eBay's policy of using HTTP links in the listing description instead of HTTPS links. This requirement includes links to externally-hosted listing images. If the server hosting the listing images does not support the HTTPS protocol, this server cannot be used to host listing images. In the API interface, the enumeration value for this compliance type is HTTPS._x005F_x000D_\\nNon-eBay Links: this compliance type is used to see if any listings are violating eBay's policy of not allowing links in the listing description to sites outside of eBay. The seller including a personal email address and/or a phone number in the listing description is also a violation of this policy. All communication between seller and buyers should be handled through eBay's communication system. The only exceptions to this outside links rule are links to product videos, information on freight shipping services, or any legally required information.
